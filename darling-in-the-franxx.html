                    In the 21st century, the progress of human civilization accelerated by ground-breaking discoveries in mining technology, 
                    allowing extraction of magma energy for a low-cost and all-encompassing energy source. Scientists who contributed to this 
                    discovery formed APE, an internationalized organization that gained large influence over politics and the global economy. 
                    After discovering human immortality, much of humanity opted to become immortal but at the cost of their reproductive systems. 
                    The magma energy drilling eventually led to the sudden emergence of the klaxosaurs, which began attacking the drilling facilities 
                    and leading to a huge number of casualties.

                <div id="story-intro">
                    <h2 id="intro-title">STORY INTRO</h2>
                    Pushed to the brink of extinction, APE led the remnants of humanity to abandon Earthâ€™s surface for 
                    the relatively safe mobile fortress-cities called Plantations. The adults live in these cities and have become immortal due to receiving injections 
                    of magma energy but at the cost of their reproductive systems. The adults live peaceful and uneventful lives within the Plantations where procreation 
                    and relationships have become obsolete. To defend the Plantations, humanoid military weapons called FRANXX were created. However, it was later found 
                    that they required a male and female pilot who retained their reproductive functions. Because all of humanity lost those functions in exchange for 
                    immortality, there were was a need for fertile children and through genetic cloning, children were born. The children, referred to as 'parasites', 
                    are educated only for piloting the FRANXX in boy-girl pairs and are kept in isolation throughout their childhoods, and placed in 
                    environments called 'Birdcages', which emulate that of a bygone era, so they can develop the emotional responses needed to pilot the FRANXX. 
                    After a century of warfare against the klaxosaurs, a parasite named Hiro, who is initially viewed as a prodigy, fails his capacity test and is deemed unfit to pilot, 
                    making him lose interest in life. While skipping out on his class's graduation ceremony, Hiro encounters Zero Two, an infamous FRANXX pilot who is actually a 
                    human-klaxosaur hybrid with red horns on her head and a dark past in which her partners die after riding with her thrice. After her partner is killed in a klaxosaur 
                    attack, Hiro says to Zero Two that he'll help her pilot her robot to defeat the klaxosaur. After they succeed, Zero Two announces she has found her 'darling'.

                        <h3 class="conflict-title">Sexuality</h3>
                        The theme of teenage sexuality is extensively explored. Raised in isolation and taught nothing beyond the morals and tales of the authoritarian world APE created, 
                        the children are oblivious to the concept of intimacy, as such a thing between parasites is illegal and warrants severe consequences. However, as the parasites 
                        endure the journey of transitioning from childhood to adulthood through puberty, they naturally experience sexuality and initially are unsure how to express their 
                        feelings. As a result; they are all caught in multiple love triangles with one another. LGBT and its effects are heavily explored, as Ikuno is in love with Ichigo 
                        but she feels ashamed and confused of her attraction to girls, which causes her deep pain to the point she despises herself.

                    <div id="sub-wrapper-2">
                        <h3 class="conflict-title">Innocence</h3>
                        Throughout the series, the parasites start off as sheltered children who lack insight into the world beyond the environment they were born and raised in. However, as 
                        the series progresses, they move past their innocence as they experience and discover the flaws of the society they live in and of the world that surrounds them. For 
                        Hiro and Zero Two, what remained of their innocence was destroyed the moment they chose to sacrifice themselves to save those dear to them and the planet. Part 
                        of growing up is moving away from the protection and sheltered-ness that comes with innocence. Yet, their move from innocence doesn't feel unnatural or bad, 
                        it is merely part of growing up and becoming an adult. It is normal for a teenager to begin to look at the world and see new things and ask different questions. 
                        It is normal to begin seeking new experiences and gaining new understandings of past experiences. That move out of innocence is normal and while it may seem to have 
                        disappeared all at once, it does draw away gradually until suddenly it seems, it is no longer there.
