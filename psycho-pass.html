                <h2>Silbyl System</h2>
                <p class="intro">
                    A powerful bio-mechanized collective mind that endlessly measures the biometrics of Japan's citizens' 
                    brains and mentalities using a "cymatic scan." The resulting assessment is called a Psycho-Pass, which includes a numeric 
                    Crime Coefficient index, revealing the citizen's criminality potential.
                </p>

                <h2>Dominator</h2>
                <p class="intro">
                    A special handgun carried by law enforcers that measures Psycho-Pass in real time. Based on the result, it may instruct the 
                    carrier to paralyze or "eliminate" the suspect immediately.

                    <h2 id="setting-title">STORY SETTING</h2>
                    When individuals' Crime Coefficient index exceeds the accepted threshold 
                    (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or decomposed by the field officers of the Crime Investigation Department of the 
                    Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau. Elite officers known as Inspectors research and evaluate crime scenes, including all personnel 
                    involved, with the assistance of Enforcers. Enforcers are latent criminals charged with protecting the Inspectors, adding their expertise 
                    and carrying out Inspectors' instructions. Both are equipped with personally activated, hand-held Dominators. Inspectors and Enforcers work 
                    as a team, though Inspectors have jurisdiction to fire their Dominators on the Enforcers should they pose a danger to the public or 
                    the Inspectors themselves.

                    <h2 id="intro-title">STORY INTRO</h2>
                    Psycho-Pass is seen through the eyes of Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector within Unit One (aka Division One) of the Ministry of Welfare 
                    Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department. Shinya Kogami is an Enforcer under her watch during her first mission. When she 
                    judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life, she uses her Dominator to prevent him from decomposing the criminal. Initially ashamed 
                    of her action, Kogami thanks her for preventing what could be perceived as murder, an opinion which influences Tsunemori to stay on the force. 
                    The unit uncovers the crimes of Shogo Makishima, a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is Criminally Asymptomatic - a person persistently 
                    assessed by the Sibyl System as having a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes, thus protecting him from 
                    Dominator harm. Tsunemori is accompanied by veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; Tomomi Masaoka, 
                    a middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; Shusei Kagari, a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; 
                    and Yayoi Kunizuka, a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist. Together, they seek to 
                    stop Makishima from committing further anti-social crimes.

                        <h3 class="conflict-title">Systematic Justice vs. Personal Justice</h3>
                        In the story of Psycho-Pass, the criminal mastermind Shogo Makishima cannot be identified as criminal by the Silbyl System due to 
                        his special condition. Thus, the Systematic Justice cannot punish his guilt. However, if the law enforcers attempt to take personal 
                        revenge on Makishima, they themselves become the enemy of the Systematic Justice (for harming "innocent person") and will thus be punished. 
                        As a result, whether or not such Personal Justice is morally right emerges as a question.
                    </div>

                    <div id="sub-wrapper-2">
                        <h3 class="conflict-title">Pre-Crime Arrest vs. Post-Crime Arrest</h3>
                        Another philosophical controversy in the story is that whether it is morally acceptable to arrest "latent criminals" (people with high Psycho-Pass 
                        but have not committed any crimes yet). In the story, the latent criminals will be confined in mental facilities for psychological therapies until
                        their Psycho-Pass fall back to normal range. Yet in reality, it is universally agreed by all legal systems that "thinking of committing a crime" does 
                        not count as a crime and is thus not punishable by the law.
